# App to calculate power for ECI bootstrap test

Here you can find the source files for the shiny R app to calculate the power for the ECI bootstrap test. You can find the app here:  https://lneums.shinyapps.io/pwreci/.
The app is based on the ECI bootstrap test with minor modifications to the bootstrap test to accomodate the power calculations. You can find the R package for the ECI bootstrap test [here](https://github.com/Hecate08/ECIbootstrap), and a preprint of the paper "Assessing Equivalent and Inverse Change in Genes Between Diverse Experiments" [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356022162_Assessing_Equivalent_and_Inverse_Change_in_Genes_Between_Diverse_Experiments).
